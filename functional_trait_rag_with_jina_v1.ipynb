            "page_content='Tropical forests are important carbon pools, comprising approximately 40% of terrestrial carbon storage (Dixon et al., 1994). The tropical forests are among the most productive ecosystems on the earth, estimated to account for above one-third of global net primary productivity (NPP) (Gaston et al., 1998;Field et al., 1998), but have been relatively under-sampled compared with their importance. Tropical deciduous forests are forests occurring in tropical regions characterized by pronounced seasonality in rainfall distribution, with few months of drought period.\\nThe aboveground biomass (AGB) of a forest ecosystem is one of the fundamental parameters describing its functioning. Studies on biomass of forest vegetation are essential for determining storage of the carbon in the dominant tree component and computing the carbon cycling at regional as well as global level. Measurement of AGB of dominant tree species in different forest communities/plant functional types is of great importance because the dominant tree species greatly influence the magnitude and pattern of energy flow that is stored in trunks, branches, leaves and roots in the form of various organic substances and material remained in continuous circulation between biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem. The quantity of AGB in a forest is the result of the difference between production through photosynthesis and consumption through respiration, mortality, harvest, and herbivory.\\nEstimation of AGB is an essential aspect of studies of carbon stocks and global carbon balance (Ketterings et al., 2001). Estimating AGB is a useful measure for comparing structural and functional attributes of forest ecosystems across a wide range of environmental conditions (Brown et al., 1999). Permanent sampling plots have long been used in ecological studies for assessing how much biomass is held in ecosystem (Brown, 2002;Fearnside, 1996). Tree AGB is strongly correlated with trunk diameter (Brown and Lugo, 1992;Brown, 1997) and it is therefore possible to use forest inventory data to estimate the stocks and changes in AGB in those inventories. So far different studies have been conducted to estimate AGB and they have mostly used diameter and height (Chave et al., 2001;Clark et al., 2001;Cummings et al., 2002;DeWalt and Chave, 2004;Malhi et al., 2004;Nascimento and Laurance, 2004;Segura and Kanninen, 2005). Variations in environmental factors such as topography, hydrology and edaphic characteristics (e.g soil nutrient availability) may also complicate attempts to generalize stand density and AGB over regional or landscape scale (Clark and Clark, 2000). AGB is thus of direct applied importance for estimating ecosystem carbon storage and fluxes (Brown, 1997;Baker et al., 2004;Fearnside, 1997;Nelson et al., 1999). Biomass fluctuation with time and space involving stand dynamics can be estimated by repeated tree census, so that changes due to growth and mortality of trees can be followed in a given area (Chave et al., 2003).\\nIndian forests are a major tropical forest ecosystem constituting nearly 701,673 sq. km (70.17 million ha), 21.34% of the geographical area of country (State of forest report (SFR), 2015). Indian tropical deciduous forest are species rich with associates of varied phenophases having irregular distribution of stem densities and basal cover. Additionally, Indian deciduous forests have multistoried canopy with different microclimate which makes it complex for understanding the patters of AGB within and among different plant functional types (PFTs) over space and time (Blackburn and Gaston, 1996;Behera et al., 2012). There remains much uncertainty how tropical forests will respond to future climate changes (Gaston et al., 1998). Information on AGB and AGBC at PFT class level in Indian tropical deciduous forests is needed for real-time assessment of national carbon stock and further global carbon crediting. Studying the AGB patterns in different PFT class will help to understand the response of climatic changes on these ecosystems and future scenarios. Detailed species level AGB measurements in different PFT classes will help to identify the keystone species sequestering higher AGB, for sustainable carbon stock management and biodiversity conservation. PFT class wise AGB assessment will also help to validate the projections of global carbon model output with ground data. Estimating the biomass stock of tropical deciduous forests and understanding their role in regulating the cycling of carbon and nutrients is on high priority (Cairns et al., 1997). Although few past studies including remote sensing approach attempted to estimate the AGB and biomass carbon in Terai regions including Doon valley, no detailed study exist investigating the patters of AGB and biomass carbon at PFT level from Indian tropical deciduous forests (Kumar, 2009;Pandey et al., 2010;Mandal and Joshi, 2014;Mohommad and Joshi, 2015). Considering the above research gaps, the presents study was undertaken in Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary at Terai region of Uttar Pradesh, India. The main objective of present study were (1) to estimate the species level AGB and AGBC in PFTs i.e. dry mixed (DM), sal mixed (SM) and teak plantation (TP) using annual DBH inventory records from long term ecological research permanent plots (LTER) and ( 2) to analyze the relation between AGB with community, as well as structural and functional variables such as species richness, basal cover, stem density, litter fall and leaf area index (LAI) in three PFTs having distinct tree species composition, different edaphic factors and microclimate conditions within a tropical moist deciduous forest ecosystem. Additionally, we attempted to establish relationship between PFT microclimate, community structural variables and diversity indices with stand AGB by having principal compo-nent analysis (PCA). We also explored the relationship between PFT AGB and annual litter fall.' metadata={'source': 'Aboveground biomass and carbon stock assessment in Indian tropical deciduous forest and relationship with stand structural attributes', 'id': '0.1'}\n",
