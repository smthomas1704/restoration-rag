            "Combustion of coal for energy generation has been a significant contributor to increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide. It is of interest to evaluate the potential of former coalfields for mitigating these increases by carbon sequestration and to compare different options to achieving this end. Here, carbon sequestration in residual coal seams and through reclamation of spoil tips is compared, and their carbon dioxide storage potential in the South Wales Coalfield estimated. Coal seam sequestration estimates come from an established methodology and consider the total unmined coal resource below 500m deep with potential for carbon sequestration. The most likely effective deep seam storage capacity is 104.9 Mt carbon dioxide, taking account of reservoir conditions and engineering factors. Whilst many spoil tips in South Wales have been reclaimed, the focus has not been on carbon sequestration potential. Estimates of minesoil restoration sequestration capacity were based on a survey of restored minesoil and vegetation carbon stocks, mainly on sites 20-30 years after restoration; data from this survey were then extrapolated to the coalfield as a whole.Minesoil storage is estimated at 1.5 or 2.5 Mt (+ 2.2 Mt in tree biomass) carbon dioxide based on average grassland or woodland measurements, respectively; modelled data predicted equilibrium values of 2.9 and 2.6 Mt carbon dioxide respectively in grassland or woodland minesoils. If all sites achieved close to the maximum capacity in their land use class, minesoil storage capacity would increase to 2.1 or 3.9 Mt carbon dioxide, respectively. Combining the best woodland minesoil and standing biomass values, sequestration capacity increases to 7.2 Mt carbon dioxide. The wider social, economic, environmental and regulatory constraints to achieving this sequestration for each approach are discussed. Coal seam sequestration has a much higher capacity but sequestration in mine sites is less costly and has fewer regulatory constraints. Findings indicate a significant combined potential for carbon sequestration in the South Wales Coalfield and highlight challenges in achieving this potential. On a global scale, ex-coalfield sequestration could contribute to broader efforts to mitigate emissions.\n",

            "AI: In addition to the strategies mentioned earlier, coal seam sequestration and reclamation of spoil tips in former coalfields can also be effective methods for carbon sequestration. Coal seam sequestration involves storing carbon dioxide in unmined coal resources below a certain depth, with the potential for significant storage capacity. Reclamation of spoil tips, on the other hand, focuses on restoring the land to promote carbon sequestration through vegetation growth and soil restoration. In the South Wales Coalfield, for example, estimates suggest that both coal seam sequestration and minesoil restoration have the potential to store significant amounts of carbon dioxide. Coal seam sequestration offers higher storage capacity, but reclamation of mine sites is often more cost-effective and faces fewer regulatory constraints. Overall, these strategies present a valuable opportunity for carbon sequestration in former coalfields, contributing to global efforts to mitigate emissions and combat climate change.\n",

This approach not only contributes to carbon sequestration but also enriches the biodiversity and ecosystem services of the restored areas. By incorporating such nature-based solutions into carbon sequestration strategies, we can maximize the benefits of carbon storage while promoting ecological restoration and resilience.\n",

            "International agendas focus on limiting unchecked climate change through extensive mitigation. Worldwide, several reforestation initiatives strive to achieve ambitious goals and promote carbon sequestration on land. The greatest potential for reforestation lies within the tropics, and the Atlantic Forest is among the protagonists. However, little is known about the potential of these reforestations to mitigate climate change. Here, we assessed the carbon sequestration potential of Atlantic Forest reforestations, both in the field and in the available scientific literature. We demonstrate that the Atlantic Forest reforestations provide valuable contributions to climate change mitigation. Even at young age, reforestations have astonishing potential, with much higher carbon sequestration rates than un-assisted natural regeneration of later successional stages. Although with lesser potential, un-assisted natural regeneration remnants can also be a valuable strategy to aid climate mitigation, especially when close to reforestations or old-growth forests. We found far greater potential of sequestration in all types of forests inside protected areas than unprotected ones, highlighting the noteworthy benefits of conservation that buffers degradation. Climate action is urgent, and the Atlantic Forest certainly is a great contributor to the achievement of such ambitious goals.\n",

These forests have been shown to have a greater potential for carbon sequestration compared to unprotected areas. By preserving these ecosystems, we can maximize their ability to store carbon and contribute to global climate change mitigation efforts. Furthermore, promoting the natural regeneration of forests in close proximity to reforestation projects or old-growth forests can also enhance carbon sequestration rates. By combining these strategies with nature-based solutions, we can optimize carbon storage potential while supporting biodiversity and ecosystem health.\n",

            "Large-scale afforestation is a key measure to mitigate global warming, however, implementation may result in land-use competition with agriculture. To avoid such competition, carbon mitigation methods using arid and semi-arid areas have been proposed, but to our knowledge there is no report of rates of sequestration based on long-term observations from actual experimentation. In this study (1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015), in an arid area near Leonora, Western Australia (annual rainfall: 220 mm year -1 ; pan evaporation: 3400 mm year -1 ), carbon sequestration was assessed in above and below ground biomass in Eucalyptus camaldulensis under ambient conditions and with active site amelioration (combination of water harvesting with large mounds and hardpan blasting). The carbon sequestration rate was estimated at 7.92 Mg-CO 2 -e ha -1 year -1 for a total carbon sink of 230 Mg-CO 2 -e ha -1 . Carbon mitigation may thus be a viable option in arid regions, not only in Western Australia but globally, and can be enhanced with active site engineering. emissions including other greenhouse gases (GHG) from land use change were the highest in human history, reaching 49 ( ± 4.5) Gt-CO 2e year -1 in 2010 (IPCC, 2014). These emissions are causing changes in the climate that will have major impacts across the global economy.\n",
