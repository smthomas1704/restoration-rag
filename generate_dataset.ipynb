        "Functional traits and trait-based community ecology theory can provide a basis for predicting the success of a restoration treatment in a particular community (Lavorel and Garnier 2002, Pywell et al. 2003, da Silveira Pontes et al. 2010, Roberts et al. 2010), helping to ensure that treatments are applied only where they will be most beneficial. Some research to date has used functional traits to predict species’ success in restoration treatments (Pywell et al. 2003, Rob- erts et al. 2010), with considerable success. For example, Pywell et al. (2003) have shown that seed germination rates and seedling growth rates are both positively associated with species success in sown restorations. These studies have suggested which species are most likely to successfully establish when creating restored communities and indicate, in a general sense, that the relative competitive and colonizing abilities of species may be predicted from their traits. However, little research has addressed how different restoration schemes, mediated by plant traits, can alter these relative abilities. For example, traits that might be advantageous under high-nutrient conditions, such as high seedling growth rates, may be disadvantageous under restored low-nutrient conditions. Such dependencies are predicted based on trait-envi- ronment relationships and can have potentially important consequences for restoration success, but have received little testing in a restoration context.\\n\\n\n",
        "Nitrogen enrichment of terrestrial habitats via atmospheric N deposition (Galloway et al. 1995, Fenn et al. 2003) and invasion of N-fixing plants (Daehler 1998) is a significant component of anthropogenic global change (Vitousek et al. 1997a). Elevated soil N can facilitate the invasion of non-native species and complicate efforts to restore native biodiversity (Maron and Connors 1996, Vitousek et al. 1997b, Perry et al. 2010). In this study, we focus on two strategies designed to restore habitats where species invasion is associ- ated with elevated N inputs (Perry et al. 2010): carbon (C) addition and the mowing and removal of above-ground biomass. Both of these\\n\n",
        "techniques have been applied in a variety of systems to control non-native species and to favor native biodiversity (Maron and Jefferies 2001, Van Dyke et al. 2004, Blumenthal 2009, Alpert 2010, Perry et al. 2010). Carbon addition is intended to stimulate bacterial growth, leading to immobilization of N in microbial biomass and a temporary decrease in plant-available N (Baer et al. 2003, Averett et al. 2004, Corbin and D’Anto- nio 2004). Mowing is meant to remove above- ground biomass, thereby reducing the competi- tive advantage of early-germinating or highly productive species, while removing mowed clippings exports N from the system (Zobel et al. 1996, Wilson and Clark 2001).\\n\\n\n",
        "Experimental tests of these methods have produced mixed results. While both treatments have been shown to decrease the exotic-to-native ratio in some ecosystems, in others native species have experienced no benefit or those benefits have been limited to a few species (e.g., Maron and Jefferies 2001, Cione et al. 2002, Van Dyke et al. 2004, Blumenthal 2009). A likely explanation for this is that the simple classification of species into ‘‘native’’ and ‘‘exotic’’ categories may pro- vide relatively little functional information. Di- rect measurement and description of plant strategies may enable better predictions for species responses to these, and other, restoration treatments (Pywell et al. 2003, Eschen et al. 2006).\\n\\n\n",
        "One useful system for describing plant strate- gies is based on three major axes quantifying leaf, growth, and reproductive strategies (Westoby 1998). Plant species are arrayed along the leaf axis according to the speed at which they obtain returns on leaf investments (Chapin 1980, Reich et al. 1997, Westoby et al. 2002, Wright et al. 2004). Species with fast returns exhibit relatively rapid turnover of leaf biomass and tend to produce thin, low density leaves with high specific leaf area (SLA) (Wright and Westoby 2000, Westoby et al. 2002, Wright et al. 2004). The growth axis describes the structural characteris- tics of a plant, of which height is a key indicator. Tall species invest in structural biomass that improves their access to light, while short species can allocate a larger portion of their biomass towards photosynthetically active tissue, which is advantageous when light is readily available (Falster and Westoby 2003). The reproductive strategy axis can be related to seed mass, as larger-seeded species typically have a higher probability of germinating and can outcompete smaller-seeded species. However, plants that produce large seeds typically produce smaller numbers of seeds, limiting their ability to colonize available microsites (e.g., Turnbull et al. 1999, Henery and Westoby 2001).\\n\\n\n",

Vitousek3\\n1University of Hawaii at Hilo, Hilo, HI 96720, USA;2Institute of Paciﬁc Islands Forestry, USDA Forest Service, Hilo,\\nHI 96720, USA; and3Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA\\nKey-words: community assembly, functional restoration, Hawaiian lowland wet forest,\\nhybrid ecosystem, invasion, multivariate trait space, tropical forest restoration\\nIntroduction\\nEcosystem restoration efforts are carried out by a variety\\nof individuals and organizations with an equally varied\\nset of goals, priorities, resources and time-scales. Once\\nrestoration of a degraded landscape or community is rec-\\nognized as necessary, choosing which species to include in\\na restoration programme can be a difﬁcult and value-\\nladen process (Fry, Power & Manning 2013; Jones 2013).\\nSpecies choice in restoration is often carried out with lim-\\nited ecological information, particularly in regard to spe-\\ncies interactions, successional processes and resource-use\\npatterns. Selecting species can be particularly problematic\\nin systems where there is no available baseline data on\\nhistorical communities, or when restoration to a historic\\nstate is not feasible for ecological, logistic or economic\\nreasons. In such cases, it may be preferable to focus on\\nrestoring site ‘functionality’ rather than returning to a his-\\ntoric baseline composition. We present a method for spe-\\ncies selection in restoration, based on the collection of\\nplant functional trait data. Using this method, managers\\ncan develop species mixtures with desired properties,\\nincluding expected predictions of interspeciﬁc interactions\\nand potential changes in biotic and abiotic conditions.\\nTo illustrate this approach, we present a case study in\\nHawaiian lowland wet forests (HLWF) in which plant\\nspecies for a restoration project were chosen based on\\ntheir functional traits, in order to help land managers\\nachieve their restoration goals while at the same time\\nallowing researchers to better understand invasion resis-\\ntance and ecosystem functioning. In our case, our choices\\nled to the development of hybrid ecosystems including\\nboth native and introduced species. However, the\\napproach that we present is not limited to novel or hybrid\\necosystem creation, because the candidate species exam-ined and functional traits measured are determined by the\\nuser.\\nWhereas restoration usually implies a return to historic\\nconditions, there is also growing attention to what some\\nauthors have called ‘intervention ecology’ ( sensu Hobbs\\net al. 2011). This view emphasizes maintaining ecosystem\\nservices and functions (Hobbs et al. 2011). The contrast\\nbetween these frameworks has been widely debated in the\\nliterature, and we do not intend to advocate the merit of\\none view over the other here. Rather, we present the logic\\nbehind a functional trait approach, describe why its use is\\nfeasible in a Hawaiian lowland forest and present a step-\\nby-step approach to the method that can be applied to a\\nwide variety of ecological systems. While we readily\\nacknowledge that in our study system, we cannot return\\nto a pre-human state, we still consider our approach ‘res-\\ntoration’ in a broad sense.\\nHow do we perform functional restoration?\\nFunctional trait theory holds that characteristics or traits\\nof each species reﬂect their resource use and life-history\\ntrade-offs (Reich 2014). A body of evidence shows that\\nplant traits vary continuously, in predictable ways, along\\nresource availability gradients –suggesting that species’\\nfunctional traits can be linked to ecosystem properties\\nand to ecosystem services (Lavorel 2013). Many studies\\nhave suggested that a robust image of a species’ func-\\ntional proﬁle can be obtained by considering traits related\\nto resource acquisition (e.g. foliar nitrogen, leaf area),\\nresource limitation (e.g. midday leaf water potential,\\nd13C-integrated water-use efﬁciency, leaf mass per area),\\nreproductive investment (e.g. height, seed mass, dispersal\\ntype) and resource allocation patterns (e.g. leaf mass per\\narea, speciﬁc root length, wood density) (Drenovsky &\\nJames 2010; Douma et al. 2012; Sonnier et al. 2012; Fry,\\nPower & Manning 2013). For restoration, selecting species\\nwith certain functional trait values can inﬂuence species\\ninteractions (including competition) and ecosystem prop-\\nerties (Suding et al. 2008).
